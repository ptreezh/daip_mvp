# DAIP-LIVE CLI Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install and use the DAIP-LIVE CLI.

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Install with pip (Recommended)

The recommended way to install the DAIP-LIVE CLI is using pip:

```bash
# Install in development mode (changes to code are reflected immediately)
pip install -e .

# Or install normally
pip install .
```

After installation, you can run the CLI using:

```bash
daip-cli --help
```

### Option 2: Run as a Python Module

You can run the CLI as a Python module without installation:

```bash
python -m src.cli --help
```

### Option 3: Run the Standalone Script

For quick access, you can use the standalone script:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS
python daip-cli.py --help

# On Windows
daip-cli.bat --help
```

## Verifying Installation

To verify that the CLI is installed correctly, run:

```bash
daip-cli status
```

This should display the system status and confirm that the CLI is working properly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the CLI installation:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed
2. Check that all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Try running the CLI using one of the alternative methods above
4. If using the installed command fails, check your PATH environment variable
